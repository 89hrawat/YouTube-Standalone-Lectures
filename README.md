# YouTube Standalone Lectures: Cloud, DevOps, Networking, and More

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for standalone YouTube tech lectures from **Cloud With VarJosh**!

This repository is your central hub for all notes, code snippets, examples, and walkthroughs from my one-off technical sessions. These lectures cover a wide range of fundamental and advanced topics in cloud, DevOps, networking, containers, and infrastructure — outside of any structured course.
